# PolyCouncil
PolyCouncil is an open-source multi-model deliberation engine for LM Studio. It runs multiple LLMs in parallel, gathers their answers, scores each response using a shared rubric, and produces a final, consensus-driven result. Designed for testing, comparing, and orchestrating local models with ease.
